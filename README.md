# MapfxData-raw
FCS files from FFC and MPC assays for testing MAPFX<br>

The sample files contain data from the single-cell murine lung data at steady state downloaded from Becht *et al., 2021* (MPC) and mice splenocytes data from Alshaweesh *et al., 2023* (FFC). The two datasets were used for testing the MAPFX package and building the Vignette.

### MPC
This dataset is a subset of the single-cell murine lung data at steady state downloaded from [FlowRepository](https://flowrepository.org/id/FR-FCM-Z2LP) [Inflow](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abg0505). The raw data contains 266 .FCS files from 266 wells with 1000 cells in each file.

### FFC
This dataset contains 316,779 cells (sorted CD4+ and CD8+ T cells) from mice splenocytes that was downloaded from [FlowRepository](http://flowrepository.org/id/FR-FCM-Z6UG) provided by Jalal Alshaweesh (Oct 2023).
